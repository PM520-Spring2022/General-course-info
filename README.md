Course slides are posted in this repository: https://github.com/PM520-Spring2022/LectureSlides

We are going to be using github to manage up/download of exercises and assignments. We encourage the use of R as a coding language for this course. Some details of how to install R and github can be found below. Please install these before the first class if you can. If you run into any problems, we can help you with them at the start of class.

1. The home page for the R project is: http://www.r-project.org/
Please follow the link downloadR in the box Getting Started.
Then download and install the most recent release.
Older machines might require an older version.

2. We will be running R using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE).
Please download and install RStudio Desktop Open Source License from the following
website: http://www.rstudio.com/

3. Please create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you do not have one.

4. You will need the software Git to talk between GitHub and RStudio. Please install Git
from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Now you will need to set your Git username and email.
Do this by opening a Terminal (cmd) Window and typing (using "Mona Lisa" as an example username):
    
    >git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
    
    confirm that the user name is set by typing
    >git config --global user.name
    >Mona Lisa
    
    Setting the email is very similar. Do this by typing
    
    >git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    
    And confirm that you have set the email address by typing:
    >git config --global user.email
    >email@example.com
    
    Directions to follow are found here, under Setting up Git:
    https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/


In-class exercises and examinable assignments will be posted here. The best way to access them will be via invites you will receive from Github classroom. (If you do it that way it will automatically set up your repositories and make them available to the instructor for feedback and grading when you are ready.)

In order to access the exercise/assignment details, pseudocode, etc., and then be able to push your solutions so that I can see them, you need to accept the invitation you will receive via email for each exercise.

When you start work on an exercises or assignment, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Accept the invitation to the assignment that you will receive by email.

2. Link the assignment to your Github ID (github will automatically ask you to do this and help you get it done).

3. Downoad the pseudocode (if there is any for that problem). The simplest way to do this using RStudio is shown in the "Hello World" exercise that we will be doing at the start of class on Week 1.

4. As you are working on the problem, regularly "commit" your work. I will not be able to see what you are doing, and comment on it, until you "push" the work back to Github. Get into the habit of committing regularly. 

5. Once you have completed your work on that problem you need to "commit" you work and then push it to github one final time. Once you have done this, please create an issue in that repository and type a message to let me know that you have uploaded your work. Please include my ID (@pmarjora) in your issue text so that Github will notify me that it is ready for me to look at.

Course Objective:
The objective of the course is to give you the skills to enable you to both be able to program, and better understand, statistical machinery using the R programming language. Note that this is not really a course about R, as such. Instead, we use R as a way of illustrating how to write code to perform a number of probabilistic and statistical procedures. We will introduce the R details as we go, but students will be expected to invest some time of their own each week, outside class, in which they improve their R programming skills if necessary.

Each week’s lecture (60-90 minutes) will focus on one or more areas in probability and statistics, describing how those procedures are performed. The rest of the class (90-120 minutes) will be a lab in which students will sit down and start to code those procedures in class. Students will be encouraged to show their work “in progress”. For example, you’ve written 30 lines of code and it isn’t working properly: we will put the code on the screen and we will all try to work out what is wrong. In other words, we will learn by doing, and by learning from our mistakes, rather than relying upon the traditional method of listening to a member of faculty drone on for 3 hours. In doing so we hope to make the course more interactive. As the saying goes: turn-about is fair play. So, as the instructor, I will also display bugged code of my own to the rest of the class, so that we can learn from my mistakes as well.

The course will be examined by a number of projects during the course. These projects will involve writing R code to perform a particular task (optimize a function, fit a regression, simulate a stochastic process,…). That code will be turned in to me and I will run it on some test problems to see how it does. In addition, the final exam will consist of your giving small group (2-3 people) presentations regarding statistical computing methods.


Recommended Textbook: “Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R” – Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet and Andrew Robinson, CRC Press. This book will (I think) be available from the USC bookstore, but can also ordered from Amazon ($70 to buy; $50 to rent).
Please note that each student will also be required to bring a laptop to each class so that they can actively write code during the lab. 

Other Material: Copies of slides will be posted, as will example bits of code. But there are a host of free online resources for R:

### STATEMENT FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to TA) as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in STU 301 and is open 8:30 a.m.–5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The phone number for DSP is (213) 740-0776.
